## Lesson 3 Willie's Letter

New York, Dec 10, 1878

Dear Santa Cloaus:

Papa is going to give me a Christmas tree, and he says that you will put nice things on it if I ask you. I would like a gun that will shoot, and a rubber ball that I can throw hard, and that will not break Mamma's windows or the big glass in the parlor.

Now, please don't forget to come> I live on Fourth St. number ten.

I will go to bed at eight o'clock, and shut my eyes tight.

I will not look indeed I won't. 

Your little boy Willie.
