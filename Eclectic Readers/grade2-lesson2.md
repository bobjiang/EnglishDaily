## Lesson 2 Bubbles

The boys have come out on the porch to blow bubbles. The old cat is asleep on the mat by the door.

"Ha! ha!" laughs Robert, as a bubble comes down softly on the old cat's back, and does not burst.

Willie tries to make his bubble do the same. This time it comes down on the cat's face, and makes her sneeze.

"She would rather wash her face without soap," says Harry. "Now let us see who can make the biggest bubble."

"I can see the house and the trees and the sky in mine," says Willie; "and such beautiful colors."

"How many, Willie?"

"Red, one; blue, two; there -- they are all out. Let us try again."

"I know how many colors there are," says Harry. "Just as many as there are in the rainbows."

"Do you know how many that is?"
